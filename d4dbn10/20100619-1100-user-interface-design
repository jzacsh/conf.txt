HOW TO: INTUITIVE
-	users can intuit what to do with the design right away
-	training unnecessary

---------------------------------------------------------------------
-	no knowledge
	-	current knowledge
		[ design = bridge this gap ]
	-	target knowledge
-	all knowledge
---------------------------------------------------------------------

intuitive:
-	current knowledge = target knowledge
-	knowledge gap very small; user doesn't perceive they're learning
