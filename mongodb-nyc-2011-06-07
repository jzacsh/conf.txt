sharding
- better at scaling writes
- uses ram

replica sets
- easily scale reads
- clust of N servers
- any 1 node can be primary
- consensus election of primary
- auto failover
- auto recover
- all writes to primary
- reads default primary ; can be secondary

write only completes on majority replication
- db.getLastError({ w : 2 }) # acknowledge write after 2 server's get it.

set member tyeps:
( type : priority # )
- nomral: 1
- passive: 0
- DR: < 1.0
- arbiter: no data, but can vote

scaling & sharding
- allows for consistent reads (eg.: financial apps).
shard key
  - pick correct shard key
    - difficult to change
    - auto increment
    - md5(data)
    - month + md5(data)


mongodb source
-   git://github.com/mongodb
    - mongo: c++, server
    - mongo-[x]-driver
    - client/ directory for extending functionality
        - eg.: serverStatus is an extension of the command class in
          client/comamnds.h


4 design ideas with MongoDB
- analytics
    - 2 colections, tiem scoped (eg.: days, months)
        eg.:
            days_2011_5
            days_2011_6
            days_2011_7

            months_2011_8
