Using the Power of Modules for Theming
    http://boston2011.design4drupal.org/sessions/using-power-modules-theming

    :

Raphael.JS; beginner
    http://boston2011.design4drupal.org/sessions/outside-garden-intro-rapha%C3%ABljs

    - uses paper object.
    - sets: collection of papers; allows batch method calls to many papers

        var c =  paper.circle();
        c.fill();

Raphael.JS; intermediate
    http://boston2011.design4drupal.org/sessions/drop-and-painter-drupal-and-rapha%C3%ABljs

    - gRaphael: http://g.raphaeljs.com/
    - extending raphael:
        ccreating plugins in Raphael.fn, `this` is the Raphael object.

    - question: which part did you start with? just getting windows/circles in
      raphael?
    - question: these "makeGraph"s the same scope?

        var Raphael.fn.boop = function () {
            var makeGraph = function() {}
            makeGarph() {}
        }
